# Rogo

A Microsoft hackathon project from 2016, a collaboration between Microsoft Employees, local Seattle high school students, and non-profits working to address the housing/homelessness crisis. All pitching in to learn about the difficulties faced trying to connect someone with shelter or assistance. 

One of those difficulties is connecting between different services, to figure out who has beds available - i.e. resource tracking and distribution. Given the 1-day timeframe, this project was more ideation than execution, leaving organizations with some possible directions/next-steps, and volunteers with some insight into what the problems on the ground are.

Our pitch was "ROGO connects local non-profit donation requests with individual and corporate donors in a single, easy to use app/website". This github exists as a slice-of-life of how far we got....just enough to give a demo at the end of the day.

There are many organizations in Seattle operating in these areas - please reach out to one of them if you wish to assist.
